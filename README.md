## Samples/Examples
I added the starting templates from previous years to the samples folder here, also feel free to use the solutions from [2022](https://github.com/gabrielbmotta/aoc_2022) or [2023](https://github.com/gabrielbmotta/aoc_2023) as starting points.

## Contributing
Feel free to fork, push to a branch on this repo, or just push to main (just make sure you're not accidentaly deleting someone else's work). If you feel like it, include your name in the license file; it almost certainly won't matter, but it's neat.
